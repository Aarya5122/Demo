    <p>Step 1 - Clone the repository<br/><code>git clone "url"</code></p>
    <p>Step 2 - Change Directory to Demo (The repository name) <code>cd Demo(for windows)</code></p>
    <p>Step 3 - Add <code>##Header2</code> to .md file which was available when we cloned the repository</p>
    <p>         Files displayed in EXPLORER column will get this alphabet towards rightmost side <code>M</code> --> The file which was available when cloned is modified</p>
    <p>Step 4 - Create a new html file and write code in it.</p>
    <p>         File with .html extension displayed in EXPLORER column will get this alphabet towards rightmost side <code>U</code> --> That means this file is Untracked i.e it was not available in the repository we cloned.</p>
    <p>Step 4 - Enter this command in cmd <code>git status</code> this tells the status of Not staged files and Untracked files</p>
    <p>Step 6 - To stage (Putting files into staging area) the files and add Untracked files for staging and making it tracked we use <code>git add .</code> (. means all the files not staged or else we can use filename)</p>
    <p>         Now we can see the new added file index.html in EXPLORER on the Right-Hand side of it is changed to A from U<br/>
                The warning or alert <code>A</code> --> The file is been added to commit
    </p>

        <code>git config --global user.name "Name"</code>
    </p>
